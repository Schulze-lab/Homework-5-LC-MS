# Assignments Week 2
# Introduction
The aim of this assignment is for you to become familiar with proteomics databases like PRIDE. By taking advantage of programmatic access to these databases, you can screen for the datasets that contain the information that you are looking for. While some details will need to be extracted manually in the end, this exercise will also give you additional starting points for the group project.
# Input data
1)	Use programmatic access to PRIDE (e.g. pridepy) to find all datasets corresponding to a species of your choice. Count and report the number of datasets.
2)	For each dataset, extract the information about which instrument was used for the measurements. Generate a plot showing the number of datasets for each of the instruments.
3)	Choose one (or more, if you like) dataset to look into the details about the sample and data processing. Summarize information that you consider relevant for the reanalysis of the dataset, e.g. the cell lysis method that has been used, any type of sample purification or chromatographic separation, parameters used for the mass spectrometric measurements. This task likely needs to be done manually (though I would be excited to see a programmatic approach), but everything else should be done programmatically.
4)	Make sure to comment your code, so that others can read and understand it easily. 
5)	Create a README file describing how to run your code. Include requirements (e.g. Python packages that need to be installed) in that description, or as a separate requirements.txt file.
6)	Commit all your input files, scripts, and result files to your GitHub Classroom repository.
# Submission
